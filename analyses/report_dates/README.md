This folder, report_dates, contains a series of scripts for analyzing reporting behaviors of criminal incidents that occur in Texas counties. 
Specifically, incidents of officer-involved shootings and civillian-involved shootings are reported here.
Counties in Texas are expected to report the incidents the Office of the Attorney General (AG) within 30 days of it occuring.
Texas Justicie Initiative (TJI) then collects reports from the AG and reports on the website (http://texasjusticeinitiative.org/). 
These scripts survey the timeliness in reporting behavior across Texas counties.
